# Symmetry breaking in minimum dissipation networks
by Aarathi Parameswaran, Andrea Benigni, Dirk Witthaut, and Iva Bačić.

We consider optimal transport networks under stochastic load fluctuations, including ring networks, multilayer networks, and an application to renewable energy systems.

# Notebooks
rings.ipynb reproduces all results for ring networks (phase diagrams, transitions, scaling).

energy_grids.ipynb applies the framework to wind and solar energy data and computes the resulting phase diagram.

multilayer_1.ipynb computes and visualizes optimal structures in simple multilayer (cube-like) networks.

multilayer_2.ipynb computes and visualizes optimal structures in extended multilayer (cube-like) networks.

multilayer_3.ipynb computes and visualizes optimal structures in extended multilayer (cube-like) networks. 

The multilayer results are sensitive to initialization and branch selection in multistable regions, especially the extended ones.

The provided pipeline reproduces the results shown in the associated work.
